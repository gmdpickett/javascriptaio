# Gamelet

A starter program for writing JavaScript games.

## Usage

1. Include the js file in an HTML document containing an element with an id of 'ball'.

```html
<div id="ball">@</div>
<script src="gamelet.js" />
```

2. The script will detect when the left or right arrow keys are pressed and will move the ball element accordingly.

3. Still need to add up and down functionality.
